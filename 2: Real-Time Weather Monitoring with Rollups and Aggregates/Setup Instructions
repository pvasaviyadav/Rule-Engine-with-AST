### Setup Instructions:

1. Get your OpenWeatherMap API key (https://openweathermap.org/).

2. Build and run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker build -t weather-monitor .
   docker run -d -p 5000:5000 weather-monitor
   ```

3. The application will call the API every 5 minutes to get weather data and store it in the database.
